# Amicus Palaeographicorum
_The Paleographer's Best Friend_

## About this project
For medieval historians, deciphering the plethora of scribal abbreviations found in many manuscripts can be a huge pain. Adriano Cappelli's _Dizionario di Abbreviature Latine_ remains one of the most comprehensive collections of scribal abbreviations to date, and this project aims to bring Cappelli's excellent work online.

Using modern web application technologies, the Amicus Palaeographicorum is the best tool for historians to look up puzzling scribal abbreviations.
